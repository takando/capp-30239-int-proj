          <h1> Population structure transition -Pupulation pyramid of G20 countries- </h1>
          <p>Population pyramid shows what percentage of population is in each age group. According to the situation of ageing, population pyramids will be defined as the following: stationary, expansive, or constrictive. Let's compare two countries among G20 countries, say Australia and Brazil. In 1950, the both pyramids are relatively wide at the bottom, thus expansive. As year passes, the shape of Australia becomes more level for all ages, categolized as stationary. On the other hand, the pyramid shape of Brazil transforms to narrow-bottomed, thus categorized as constrictive. Currently expansive countries have younger population, but there also would be the possibility that their population would be rapidly aged and become seriously constrictive in the future.</p>

          <h1> Ageing speed and depth -Population ageing rate- </h1>
          <p>The aspect of population ageing could be summarized as its degree and speed. The graph shows the prospect of proportion of over 65 years old people for all countries. Overall, we can see that world population would be ageing rapidly after 2020. However, the pace differs significantly by countries. For example, Japan is already one of the most aged country in the world, and it will continue to be ageing in next a few decades. However, the pace of ageing will slow down after that. In contrast, some other countries, such as Albania, Puerto Rico and South Korea will be aged very fast and the proportion of elderly people would reach to around 40 % by 2100. Now most of countries which have lower ageing rate are African countries, but they will also have the possibility of facing serious population ageing in the late 21st century.</p>
