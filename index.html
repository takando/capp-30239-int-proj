          <h1> Population transition -Pupulation pyramid- </h1>
          <p>Population pyramid shows what percentage of population is in each age group. According to the situation of ageing, population pyramids will be defined as the following: stationary, expansive, or constrictive. Let's compare two countries, say Australia and Afghanistan. In 1950, the both pyramids are relatively wide at the bottom, thus expansive. As year passes, the shape of Australia becomes more level for all ages, categolized as stationary. On the other hand, the pyramid shape of Afghanistan transforms to narrow-bottomed, thus constrictive.</p>

          <h1> Ageing speed and depth -Population ageing rate- </h1>
          <p>The aspect of population ageing could be summarized as its degree and speed. For example, Japan is already one of the most aged country in the world, and it will still continue to be ageing rapidly in next a few decades. However, the pace of ageing will slow down after that and start to decline in late 21st century. In contrast, the United states will show constant population ageing, and it will reach to close level with Japan. The developing countries, such as Angola, has much lower ageing rate now, and the pace of ageing will also keep slow during centuries.</p>
